# Aardvark.Web

Aardvark.Web is an attempt to port Aardvarks core concepts to JavaScript using Fable.
This is a very early prototype and does not provide any documentation.

Aardvark.Web is a project by [Aardworx](https://aardworx.com/).

## Building

On windows simply run `build build` to compile the demo application or use `build start` to start an interactive webpack server.
Sadly building on Mac/Linux is currently not possible (or at least difficult).

Note that compiling might take some time, since we currently use a custom fable-compiler, which will also be built on first start.
