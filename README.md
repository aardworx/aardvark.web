# Aardvark.Web

Aardvark.Web is an attempt to port Aardvarks core concepts to JavaScript using Fable.
This is a very early prototype and does not provide any documentation.

## Building

on windows simply run `build build` to compile the demo application or use `build start` to start an interactive webpack server.

Note that compiling might take some time, since we currently use a custom fable-compiler, which will also be built on first start.
