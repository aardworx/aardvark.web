# Aardvark.Web

Aardvark.Web is an attempt to port Aardvarks core concepts to JavaScript using Fable.
This is a very early prototype and does not provide any documentation.

Aardvark.Web is a project by [Aardworx](https://aardworx.com/).
Works with [FShade](https://fshade.org/). Check it out at [FShade repl](https://fshade.org/repl).

## Building

Simply run `build build` to compile the demo application or use `build start` to start an interactive webpack server.

Linux/Mac build is currently untested

Note that compiling might take some time, since we currently use a custom fable-compiler, which will also be built on first start.
